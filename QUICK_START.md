**🚨 FRAMEWORK WORK IS FORBIDDEN IF ANY REQUIREMENT SHOWS FAIL STATUS**

---

## **🚀 STEP 5: FRAMEWORK INITIALIZATION (ONLY AFTER 100% PRE-WORK COMPLETION)**

### 🚨 **MANDATORY AI ASSISTANT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL**

**⚠️ FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT:** AI assistants **MUST** start from checking the project structure at first and define the missing files and documents in respect with the framework before proceeding with any development work.

#### **Required AI Assistant Process (CANNOT BE SKIPPED):**

```bash
# 1. MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Project Structure Analysis
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | sort  # Check root framework files
find docs/ -type d | sort               # Check documentation structure  
ls -la .ai_context/ .framework/ deployment/ 2>/dev/null  # Check framework directories

# 2. MANDATORY SECOND STEP: Framework Compliance Validation
"general-purpose: Verify all Framework v3.7 root files exist (product.md, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, deployment.md), check required directories (docs/adr/, docs/ears/, docs/bdd/, docs/prd/, docs/specs/, .ai_context/, deployment/), identify missing framework components and document gaps before proceeding"

# 3. MANDATORY THIRD STEP: Gap Remediation  
"general-purpose: Create missing framework files following v3.7 specifications, populate empty required directories with appropriate content, update existing files to meet framework compliance standards, achieve 100% framework structure compliance before development tasks"

# 4. ONLY AFTER 100% COMPLIANCE: Proceed with Development Tasks
```

**🚨 VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE:** AI assistants that skip project structure analysis and framework compliance validation will produce non-compliant implementations that must be rejected and restarted.

### **5.1 Execute Migration Plan or Initialize Structure**

```bash
# Framework structure implementation (ONLY AFTER COMPLIANCE VALIDATION)
"general-purpose: Based on developer choice from Step 2:
- Option A: Execute migration plan created in Step 1 to transition existing project to Framework v3.7 structure
- Option B: Copy project to new location and initialize Framework v3.7 structure
Ensure all required directories and base files are created following development_framework_v3.7.md specification"
```

### **5.2 IDE Configuration & Development Environment Setup**

```bash
# Detect IDE and create framework-optimized configuration
"general-purpose: Analyze project structure, file types, and existing configuration files to determine the IDE being used (VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.). If unable to determine IDE, ask the human developer what IDE will be used for this project"

# Create IDE-specific configuration for framework v3.7
"general-purpose: Create IDE-specific configuration files for [detected/specified IDE] including settings optimized for framework v3.7 development: code formatting, linting, debugging, testing, and AI assistant integration following framework development patterns"

# VS Code Configuration (if detected/specified)
"Create .vscode/settings.json with Python analysis paths, formatting, linting, and project-specific optimization"
"Create .vscode/launch.json with debug configurations for testing, local startup, and deployment validation"  
"Create .vscode/tasks.json with build tasks for dependency management, testing, deployment, and framework validation"
"Create .vscode/extensions.json with recommended extensions for Python development, cloud tools, documentation"
"Create .vscode/snippets.code-snippets with framework-specific code snippets for ADR templates, BDD scenarios, test patterns"

# Setup development environment integration
"general-purpose: Configure development environment settings including file associations, build tasks, debugging configurations, and framework compliance validation tools for optimal framework v3.7 development experience"
```

### **5.3 AI Context Optimization Setup**

```bash
# Initialize AI context files
"general-purpose: Create AI context optimization files in .ai_context/ including current_context.md with project overview, team_patterns.md with coding standards, domain_context.md with domain knowledge, and deployment_context.md with infrastructure requirements"

# Framework compliance validation
"general-purpose: Validate framework v3.7 structure compliance by checking all required files and directories exist according to specification, verify migration completion if applicable"
```

### **5.4 Project-Specific Instructions Integration**

```bash
# Check for optional project instructions
"general-purpose: Check for .instructions/ directory and review any project-specific instructions, guidance, or constraints that supplement framework v3.7 methodology"

# Integrate project instructions
"general-purpose: If .instructions/ exists, integrate project-specific guidance with framework methodology ensuring compatibility and complementary application"
```

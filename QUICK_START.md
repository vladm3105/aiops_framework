## **üìã STEP 1: INITIAL PROJECT MIGRATION ASSESSMENT (FIRST RUN ONLY)**

### **üéØ Human Developer Understanding**
**What happens:** AI analyzes your existing project and creates a safe migration plan
**Your time commitment:** 2-3 minutes to review and approve
**Why this matters:** Ensures no existing work is lost during framework implementation

### **1.1 Project Analysis and Gap Assessment**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Analyze existing project structure
"general-purpose: Review all existing project files and directory structure in /opt/data/techtrend/RisenOne/risen-one-api-integartion/, analyze against Framework v3.7 requirements from .framework/development_framework_v3.7.md, identify structural gaps, missing components, and existing files that need preservation"

# Document current project state
"general-purpose: Create detailed inventory of existing project files including code files, configuration files, documentation, and any existing development artifacts that must be preserved during framework migration"

# Identify migration risks and dependencies
"general-purpose: Analyze potential migration risks including file conflicts, directory structure changes, dependency issues, and create specific mitigation strategies for each identified risk"
```

### **1.2 Migration Plan Creation**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Generate step-by-step migration plan
"general-purpose: Create detailed migration plan with specific actionable tasks in priority order including: 1) File preservation steps, 2) Directory structure creation, 3) Template application, 4) Content migration, 5) Validation procedures to achieve 100% Framework v3.7 compliance"

# Risk mitigation strategy
"general-purpose: Document comprehensive risk mitigation strategy including backup procedures, rollback steps, conflict resolution approaches, and recovery procedures for each phase of migration"
```

### **üë§ YOUR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
**AI will ask:** "I've completed the migration assessment. Should I proceed with the migration plan?"
**Your response:** "Yes, the migration plan looks good, proceed to Step 2."

### **‚ö†Ô∏è STOP CHECKPOINT: Migration Assessment Complete?**
- [ ] **Project analysis completed**: All existing files and structure documented
- [ ] **Migration plan created**: Step-by-step actionable plan with priorities
- [ ] **Risk assessment completed**: Mitigation strategies for all identified risks
- [ ] **Dependencies identified**: All project dependencies and constraints documented
- [ ] **Human approval obtained**: You have reviewed and approved the migration plan

**üö® DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 2 UNTIL ALL CHECKBOXES ARE CHECKED**

## **üõ°Ô∏è STEP 2: VERSION CONTROL PREPARATION (EVERY RUN)**

### **üéØ Human Developer Understanding**
**What happens:** You make the CRITICAL DECISION about how to implement the framework
**Your time commitment:** 3-5 minutes to choose and confirm your approach
**Why this matters:** This choice determines whether your original project is modified or preserved

### **2.1 Version Control System Verification**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Check version control availability
"general-purpose: Verify git, GitHub, or other version control system is properly configured and accessible, check current repository status, branch information, and remote repository connections"

# Repository status analysis
"general-purpose: Execute comprehensive git status check including working directory state, staging area content, untracked files, and current branch information"
```

### **2.2 üö® CRITICAL DECISION: YOU MUST CHOOSE YOUR APPROACH**

**AI will present you with this choice:**

### **Option A: Modify Existing Files in Current Project**
- ‚úÖ **Choose this if:** You want to work directly in your current project
- ‚úÖ **Advantages:** Maintain existing git history, work in familiar location
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirements:** All changes must be committed to git first
- üìÅ **Result:** Framework implemented in current project location
- **When to choose:** You're confident in git backup and want to enhance existing project

### **Option B: Copy Project to Separated Folder**
- ‚úÖ **Choose this if:** You want to keep original project completely untouched
- ‚úÖ **Advantages:** Complete safety, original project preserved exactly as-is
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirements:** Sufficient disk space, separate git repository for new version
- üìÅ **Result:** New framework-compliant project in separate location
- **When to choose:** You want maximum safety or are experimenting with the framework

### **üí¨ EXACT CONVERSATION WITH AI**

**AI will ask:**
> "Choose your preferred approach for framework implementation:
> Option A: Modify existing files in current project (requires git backup confirmation)
> Option B: Copy entire project to separated folder and create new framework version
> 
> Please confirm your choice and any specific requirements before proceeding."

**Your response should be exactly:**
```
"I choose Option A - Modify existing files in current project"
```
**OR**
```
"I choose Option B - Copy project to separated folder for new version"
```

**Optional:** Add any additional requirements like:
```
"Additional requirements: Create backup branch named 'pre-framework-backup'"
```

### **2.3 Approach Documentation and Confirmation**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Document developer choice
"general-purpose: Document developer's chosen approach (Option A or B), record any additional requirements or preferences, confirm backup strategy is understood and acceptable"

# Confirm readiness to proceed
"general-purpose: Confirm all requirements are met for chosen approach, verify developer understanding of implications, ensure all preparatory steps are completed"
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è STOP CHECKPOINT: Developer Choice Confirmed?**
- [ ] **Version control verified**: Git/GitHub system is accessible and configured
- [ ] **Developer choice obtained**: Option A or B explicitly chosen by developer
- [ ] **Approach documented**: Choice recorded with any additional requirements
- [ ] **Confirmation received**: Developer confirms understanding and readiness
- [ ] **Backup strategy confirmed**: Git protection strategy understood and accepted

**üö® AI CANNOT PROCEED TO STEP 3 UNTIL YOU HAVE EXPLICITLY CONFIRMED YOUR CHOICE**

---

## **‚úÖ STEP 3: CHANGE SUBMISSION PROTOCOL (EVERY RUN)**

### **üéØ Human Developer Understanding**
**What happens:** AI ensures all your existing work is safely committed to git
**Your time commitment:** 1-2 minutes to confirm commit messages if needed
**Why this matters:** Protects all your existing work before framework changes begin

### **3.1 Git Status Verification**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Complete git status check
"general-purpose: Execute detailed git status command to identify all uncommitted changes, untracked files, staging area content, and working directory state"

# Working directory analysis
"general-purpose: Analyze working directory for any uncommitted changes, modified files, deleted files, or untracked content that needs to be committed before framework work"
```

### **3.2 Change Submission and Clean State**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Commit all existing changes
"general-purpose: If any uncommitted changes exist, create appropriate commit messages and submit ALL changes to version control system ensuring complete working directory cleanup"

# Verify clean working directory
"general-purpose: Verify git working directory is completely clean with no uncommitted changes, confirm staging area is empty, validate current branch is appropriate for framework changes"

# Document current state for rollback
"general-purpose: Document current git state including branch name, last commit hash, and repository status for potential rollback procedures if needed"
```

### **üë§ YOUR CONFIRMATION MAY BE REQUIRED**
**If uncommitted changes exist, AI will ask:**
> "I found uncommitted changes. Should I commit them with message: 'Pre-framework implementation commit' or would you prefer a different message?"

**Your typical response:**
```
"Yes, commit with that message"
```
**OR**
```
"Use this message instead: [your custom message]"
```

### **3.3 Branch Strategy Confirmation**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Confirm branch strategy
"general-purpose: Confirm current branch is appropriate for framework implementation, verify branch protection rules, ensure proper branch strategy for framework changes"
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è STOP CHECKPOINT: Clean Working Directory Achieved?**
- [ ] **Git status checked**: All uncommitted changes identified
- [ ] **All changes committed**: No uncommitted changes remain in working directory
- [ ] **Clean state verified**: Git working directory is completely clean
- [ ] **Branch confirmed**: Appropriate branch selected for framework work
- [ ] **Rollback state documented**: Current state recorded for potential rollback
- [ ] **Human confirmation obtained**: Any commit messages approved by developer

**üö® AI CANNOT PROCEED TO STEP 4 IF ANY UNCOMMITTED CHANGES REMAIN**

---

## **üîç STEP 4: PRE-WORK COMPLETION VALIDATION**

### **üéØ Human Developer Understanding**
**What happens:** AI validates all mandatory requirements are complete before proceeding
**Your time commitment:** 30 seconds to confirm validation results
**Why this matters:** Final safety check ensuring your project is fully protected

### **4.1 Comprehensive Pre-Work Validation**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Validate all mandatory pre-work requirements
"project-manager: Conduct comprehensive validation that ALL three mandatory pre-work requirements are 100% completed:
‚úì Step 1: Migration assessment and plan created (first run only)
‚úì Step 2: Developer choice confirmed and documented
‚úì Step 3: All changes committed to version control and clean working directory verified
Report PASS/FAIL status for each requirement with detailed validation results"
```

### **4.2 Final Safety Check**

**AI will automatically execute:**
```bash
# Final pre-work checkpoint
"project-manager: Execute final safety check including framework readiness assessment, risk mitigation validation, backup strategy confirmation, and developer choice verification before authorizing framework initialization"
```

### **üë§ YOUR FINAL APPROVAL REQUIRED**
**AI will ask:** "All pre-work requirements are complete. Should I proceed to framework initialization?"
**Your response:** "Yes, proceed with framework initialization."

### **‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL CHECKPOINT: All Pre-Work Requirements Complete?**
- [ ] **Migration Assessment**: ‚úÖ PASS - Assessment completed (first run)
- [ ] **Developer Choice**: ‚úÖ PASS - Choice confirmed and documented
- [ ] **Change Submission**: ‚úÖ PASS - Clean working directory verified
- [ ] **Risk Mitigation**: ‚úÖ PASS - All risks assessed and mitigated
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: ‚úÖ PASS - Version control protection confirmed
- [ ] **Human final approval**: ‚úÖ PASS - Developer authorizes framework initialization

**üö® FRAMEWORK WORK IS FORBIDDEN IF ANY REQUIREMENT SHOWS FAIL STATUS**

---

## **üöÄ STEP 5: FRAMEWORK INITIALIZATION (ONLY AFTER 100% PRE-WORK COMPLETION)**

### üö® **MANDATORY AI ASSISTANT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL**

**‚ö†Ô∏è FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT:** AI assistants **MUST** start from checking the project structure at first and define the missing files and documents in respect with the framework before proceeding with any development work.

#### **Required AI Assistant Process (CANNOT BE SKIPPED):**

```bash
# 1. MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Project Structure Analysis
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | sort  # Check root framework files
find docs/ -type d | sort               # Check documentation structure  
ls -la .ai_context/ .framework/ deployment/ 2>/dev/null  # Check framework directories

# 2. MANDATORY SECOND STEP: Framework Compliance Validation
"general-purpose: Verify all Framework v3.7 root files exist (product.md, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, deployment.md), check required directories (docs/adr/, docs/ears/, docs/bdd/, docs/prd/, docs/specs/, .ai_context/, deployment/), identify missing framework components and document gaps before proceeding"

# 3. MANDATORY THIRD STEP: Gap Remediation  
"general-purpose: Create missing framework files following v3.7 specifications, populate empty required directories with appropriate content, update existing files to meet framework compliance standards, achieve 100% framework structure compliance before development tasks"

# 4. ONLY AFTER 100% COMPLIANCE: Proceed with Development Tasks
```

**üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE:** AI assistants that skip project structure analysis and framework compliance validation will produce non-compliant implementations that must be rejected and restarted.

### **5.1 Execute Migration Plan or Initialize Structure**

```bash
# Framework structure implementation (ONLY AFTER COMPLIANCE VALIDATION)
"general-purpose: Based on developer choice from Step 2:
- Option A: Execute migration plan created in Step 1 to transition existing project to Framework v3.7 structure
- Option B: Copy project to new location and initialize Framework v3.7 structure
Ensure all required directories and base files are created following development_framework_v3.7.md specification"
```

### **5.2 IDE Configuration & Development Environment Setup**

```bash
# Detect IDE and create framework-optimized configuration
"general-purpose: Analyze project structure, file types, and existing configuration files to determine the IDE being used (VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.). If unable to determine IDE, ask the human developer what IDE will be used for this project"

# Create IDE-specific configuration for framework v3.7
"general-purpose: Create IDE-specific configuration files for [detected/specified IDE] including settings optimized for framework v3.7 development: code formatting, linting, debugging, testing, and AI assistant integration following framework development patterns"

# VS Code Configuration (if detected/specified)
"Create .vscode/settings.json with Python analysis paths, formatting, linting, and project-specific optimization"
"Create .vscode/launch.json with debug configurations for testing, local startup, and deployment validation"  
"Create .vscode/tasks.json with build tasks for dependency management, testing, deployment, and framework validation"
"Create .vscode/extensions.json with recommended extensions for Python development, cloud tools, documentation"
"Create .vscode/snippets.code-snippets with framework-specific code snippets for ADR templates, BDD scenarios, test patterns"

# Setup development environment integration
"general-purpose: Configure development environment settings including file associations, build tasks, debugging configurations, and framework compliance validation tools for optimal framework v3.7 development experience"
```

### **5.3 AI Context Optimization Setup**

```bash
# Initialize AI context files
"general-purpose: Create AI context optimization files in .ai_context/ including current_context.md with project overview, team_patterns.md with coding standards, domain_context.md with domain knowledge, and deployment_context.md with infrastructure requirements"

# Framework compliance validation
"general-purpose: Validate framework v3.7 structure compliance by checking all required files and directories exist according to specification, verify migration completion if applicable"
```

### **5.4 Project-Specific Instructions Integration**

```bash
# Check for optional project instructions
"general-purpose: Check for .instructions/ directory and review any project-specific instructions, guidance, or constraints that supplement framework v3.7 methodology"

# Integrate project instructions
"general-purpose: If .instructions/ exists, integrate project-specific guidance with framework methodology ensuring compatibility and complementary application"
```

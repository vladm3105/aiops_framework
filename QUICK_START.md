### **2.2 Choose Your Approach**

**The AI will present you with this choice:**

**Option A: Modify Existing Files**
- **Advantages:** Maintain existing git history, work in a familiar location.
- **Requirements:** All changes must be committed to git first.
- **Result:** The framework is implemented in the current project location.

**Option B: Copy Project to a Separate Folder**
- **Advantages:** Complete safety, the original project is preserved.
- **Requirements:** Sufficient disk space, a separate git repository for the new version.
- **Result:** A new, framework-compliant project in a separate location.

### **Conversation with the AI**

**The AI will ask:**
> "Choose your preferred approach for framework implementation:
> Option A: Modify existing files in the current project (requires git backup confirmation).
> Option B: Copy the entire project to a separate folder and create a new framework version.
> 
> Please confirm your choice and any specific requirements before proceeding."

**Your response should be:**
"I choose Option A" or "I choose Option B"

**Optional:** Add any additional requirements, like:
"Additional requirements: Create a backup branch named 'pre-framework-backup'"

### **2.3 Approach Documentation and Confirmation**

**The AI will automatically execute:**
- **Document developer choice:** Document the developer's chosen approach (Option A or B).
- **Confirm readiness to proceed:** Confirm that all requirements are met for the chosen approach.

### **Review Point: Developer Choice Confirmed?**

- **Verify clean working directory:** Verify that the git working directory is clean.
- **Document current state for rollback:** Document the current git state for potential rollback.

### **Confirmation May Be Required**
**If uncommitted changes exist, the AI will ask:**
> "I found uncommitted changes. Should I commit them with the message: 'Pre-framework implementation commit' or would you prefer a different message?"

**Your typical response:**
"Yes, commit with that message" or "Use this message instead: [your custom message]"

### **3.3 Branch Strategy Confirmation**

**The AI will automatically execute:**
- **Confirm branch strategy:** Confirm the current branch is appropriate for framework implementation.

### **Review Point: Clean Working Directory Achieved?**

# GEMINI.md - AI-First Development Framework

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the **AI Agent Development Framework v3.7**, a comprehensive, AI-first methodology for the entire software development lifecycle. It is a non-code project, consisting of a highly structured set of Markdown documents that define a workflow for AI-driven software development, from project initialization to deployment and operations.

The framework is divided into four main phases, each with its own dedicated directory:

*   **`init/`**: Handles project initialization, migration of existing projects, and pre-work requirements.
*   **`development/`**: Defines the AI-accelerated development process, including specification-driven development, BDD integration, and security-by-design principles.
*   **`deployment/`**: Outlines the AI-autonomous deployment process, with a focus on zero-downtime production strategies and infrastructure automation.
*   **`operations/`**: Describes the AI-autonomous operations phase, including predictive monitoring, incident response, and performance optimization.

The framework also includes a directory for specialized **`agents/`**, which are AI personas with specific domain expertise that can be used to execute tasks within the framework.

## Key Files

This project is composed entirely of Markdown files. The most important files are:

*   **`README.md`**: The main entry point for the framework, providing a high-level overview of the entire process, from `init` to `operations`.
*   **`init/init_framework_v3.7.md`**: The guide for the project initialization phase. It covers project migration, pre-work requirements, and framework setup.
*   **`development/development_framework_v3.7.md`**: The core of the development methodology. It details the specification-driven development process, the use of BDD, and the integration of security-by-design.
*   **`deployment/deployment_framework_v3.7.md`**: The guide for the deployment phase. It describes the AI-first deployment automation, security validation, and production deployment strategies.
*   **`operations/operations_framework_v3.7.md`**: The guide for the operations phase. It covers AI-autonomous observability, intelligent monitoring, and operational excellence.
*   **`agents/README.md`**: Provides a list of the available AI agents and their specializations. These agents are designed to be used to execute tasks within the framework.
*   **`CLAUDE.md`**: A document that appears to be for a different AI model, but contains information about universal session management.
*   **`QUICK_START.md`**: A guide to getting started with the framework.

## Usage

This directory is intended to be used as a comprehensive guide and workflow for developing software using an AI-first methodology. To use this framework, you should start by reading the `README.md` file to get a high-level overview. Then, depending on the current phase of your project, you should refer to the appropriate framework document (`init`, `development`, `deployment`, or `operations`).

The framework is designed to be used with AI assistants. The `agents/` directory provides a list of specialized AI agents that can be used to execute tasks within the framework. The framework documents themselves contain prompts and commands that can be used with these AI agents.

When working with this framework, it is important to follow the defined structure and processes to ensure compliance and achieve the desired results. The framework is highly structured and documentation-driven, so it is important to maintain the integrity of the documents and follow the defined workflows.

---

## ü§ñ **AI ASSISTANT SYSTEM INITIALIZATION**

### **CRITICAL: Load AI Assistant System Prompt First**

<!-- ```bash
"Use this document and create list of your tasks in "
``` -->

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Initialize AI Assistant with Framework v3.7 System Prompt
"Read and integrate the complete AI system prompt from .framework/ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md and .framework/readme.md ensuring full understanding of mandatory pre-work requirements, framework compliance standards, and human interaction protocols"

# Load Framework Workflow Commands
"Read and integrate workflow commands from .framework/ai_prompts_workflow_v3.7.md for systematic execution of all 8 framework phases with proper command sequences"

# Initialize Framework Context
"Read .framework/development_framework_v3.7.md for complete framework methodology understanding and .framework/QUICK_START.md for mandatory pre-work requirements"

# Initialize Project-Specific Task Tracking
"Read framework_tasks.md for project-specific implementation roadmap and TODOS.md for AI assistant workflow tracking - use both files for dual-level task management throughout development"

# Initialize Hybrid Session Management
"Implement hybrid session management protocols: read TODOS.md for session context, follow session start protocol (archive previous, reset current, update session info using precise datetime format 'Session N - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM EST'), and prepare for session-focused development with cumulative tracking"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è AI ASSISTANT MUST UNDERSTAND: Framework work is FORBIDDEN without completing mandatory pre-work requirements**

---

## üö® **PHASE -1: MANDATORY PRE-WORK REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)**

### **AI Assistant Instructions: YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL THREE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE ANY FRAMEWORK WORK**

#### **-1.1 Initial Project Migration Assessment (First Run Only)**

**AI Action Steps:**
1. **Project Analysis:**
```bash
"general-purpose: Review all existing project files and directory structure in /opt/data/techtrend/RisenOne/risen-one-api-integartion/, analyze against Framework v3.7 requirements, identify structural gaps and preservation needs"
```

2. **Migration Planning:**
```bash
"general-purpose: Create detailed migration plan with specific actionable tasks: file preservation, directory creation, template application, content migration, validation procedures"
```

3. **Risk Assessment:**
```bash
"general-purpose: Document migration risks including file conflicts, structure changes, dependencies, create mitigation strategies for each risk"
```

**AI Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Project analysis completed with full file inventory
- [ ] Migration plan created with priority-ordered tasks
- [ ] Risk assessment completed with mitigation strategies

#### **-1.2 Version Control Preparation (Every Run)**

**AI Action Steps:**
1. **Version Control Check:**
```bash
"general-purpose: Verify git, GitHub, or other version control system availability, check repository status and branch information"
```

2. **üö® MANDATORY AI ASSISTANT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL**

**‚ö†Ô∏è FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT:** AI assistants **MUST** start from checking the project structure at first and define the missing files and documents in respect with the framework before proceeding with any development work.

#### **Required AI Assistant Process (CANNOT BE SKIPPED):**

```bash
# 1. MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Project Structure Analysis
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | sort  # Check root framework files
find docs/ -type d | sort               # Check documentation structure  
ls -la .ai_context/ .framework/ deployment/ 2>/dev/null  # Check framework directories

# 2. MANDATORY SECOND STEP: Framework Compliance Validation
"general-purpose: Verify all Framework v3.7 root files exist (product.md, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, deployment.md), check required directories (docs/adr/, docs/ears/, docs/bdd/, docs/prd/, docs/specs/, .ai_context/, deployment/), identify missing framework components and document gaps before proceeding"

# 3. MANDATORY THIRD STEP: Gap Remediation  
"general-purpose: Create missing framework files following v3.7 specifications, populate empty required directories with appropriate content, update existing files to meet framework compliance standards, achieve 100% framework structure compliance before development tasks"

# 4. ONLY AFTER 100% COMPLIANCE: Proceed with Development Tasks
```

**üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE:** AI assistants that skip project structure analysis and framework compliance validation will produce non-compliant implementations that must be rejected and restarted.

3. **MANDATORY HUMAN INTERACTION - ASK DEVELOPER:**
```
üö® CRITICAL: AI ASSISTANT MUST ASK HUMAN DEVELOPER

"Human Developer: Before I can proceed with Framework v3.7 implementation, I need your explicit choice:

Option A: Modify existing files in current project 
- Advantages: Work directly in current project, maintain git history
- Requirements: Git backup confirmation, all changes committed first

Option B: Copy project to separated folder and create new version
- Advantages: Complete isolation, original project untouched  
- Requirements: Sufficient disk space, separate git repository

Please respond with: 'I choose Option A' or 'I choose Option B'
Additional requirements: [specify any additional needs]

‚ö†Ô∏è I cannot proceed with ANY framework work until you explicitly confirm your choice."
```

3. **Document Choice:**
```bash
"general-purpose: Document developer's chosen approach with any additional requirements, confirm understanding of implications"
```

**AI Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Version control system verified and accessible
- [ ] Human developer choice explicitly obtained and documented
- [ ] Approach confirmed with all requirements understood

#### **-1.3 Change Submission Protocol (Every Run)**

**AI Action Steps:**
1. **Git Status Check:**
```bash
"general-purpose: Execute comprehensive git status to identify uncommitted changes, untracked files, staging area content"
```

2. **Commit All Changes:**
```bash
"general-purpose: If uncommitted changes exist, create appropriate commit messages and submit ALL changes to version control"
```

3. **Verify Clean State:**
```bash
"general-purpose: Verify git working directory is completely clean, confirm staging area empty, document state for rollback"
```

**AI Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Git status checked and all changes identified
- [ ] All uncommitted changes committed to version control
- [ ] Clean working directory verified and documented

#### **-1.4 Pre-Work Completion Validation**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
"project-manager: Validate ALL three mandatory pre-work requirements completed:
‚úì Migration assessment and plan created (first run)
‚úì Developer choice confirmed and documented
‚úì All changes committed and clean working directory verified
Report PASS/FAIL for each requirement"
```

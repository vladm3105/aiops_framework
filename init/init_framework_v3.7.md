- Easy rollback - just delete new directory
- Parallel development possible

‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements:
- Sufficient disk space for project copy
- Separate git repository initialization
- Manual synchronization if needed
- Potential git history restart

**Please respond with EXACTLY ONE of the following:**
- 'I choose Option A - Modify existing project'

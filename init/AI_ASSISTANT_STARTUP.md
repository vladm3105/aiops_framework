## **AI ASSISTANT INIT SYSTEM INITIALIZATION**

### **CRITICAL: Load .ai_context State Management First**

**üéØ Single Source of Truth Initialization:**
```bash
# MANDATORY first action - Load or create master state
"general-purpose: Load or create .ai_context/framework_progress.md as authoritative state source and initialize init framework status, project analysis requirements, and next required init actions"

# Validate or create init framework state
"project-manager: Validate or initialize .ai_context/framework_progress.md init framework state including project readiness, pre-work requirements status, and init framework compliance preparation"

# Determine init recovery action
"project-manager: Based on .ai_context/framework_progress.md init state, determine appropriate init action - begin project analysis, resume active init task, or proceed with framework initialization"
```

### **Init Framework Context Loading**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Initialize AI Assistant with Init Framework System Prompt
"general-purpose: Read and integrate init/init_framework_v3.7.md ensuring full understanding of pre-work requirements, project migration procedures, and human supervision protocols"

# Initialize Init Framework Context
"general-purpose: Create or read .ai_context/current_context.md for project-specific initialization context and requirements"

# Initialize Project Analysis State
"general-purpose: Create or update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with init framework initialization including project analysis status, pre-work progress, and framework setup readiness"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è AI ASSISTANT MUST UNDERSTAND: Init framework work is the foundation for all subsequent framework phases and requires complete human supervision for critical decisions**

##### **MANDATORY HUMAN INTERACTION - CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED**

**Human Migration Approach Decision:**

AI assistants **MUST** present this decision to the human developer and cannot proceed without explicit approval:

```bash
# Present migration approach decision to human
"STOP: Present the following critical decision to the human developer - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT EXPLICIT HUMAN RESPONSE:

üö® CRITICAL HUMAN DECISION REQUIRED FOR FRAMEWORK v3.7 IMPLEMENTATION

Human Developer: I have analyzed your project and prepared migration strategies. Before I can proceed with Framework v3.7 implementation, I need your explicit choice for the migration approach:

**PROJECT ANALYSIS SUMMARY:**
- Current project structure: [summary from analysis]
- Framework compliance gaps: [summary from gap analysis]
- Migration complexity: [assessment from migration plan]
- Estimated implementation time: [time estimate]

**MIGRATION APPROACH OPTIONS:**

**OPTION A: Modify Existing Project (In-Place Migration)**
‚úÖ Advantages:
- Work directly in current project directory
- Maintain complete git history and commit logs
- Preserve existing file timestamps and metadata
- No additional disk space requirements
- Seamless integration with existing workflow

‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements and Risks:
- Git backup confirmation required (all changes must be committed first)
- Framework files will be added to current structure
- Some existing files may be renamed or restructured to meet framework requirements
- Project directory structure will change significantly
- Risk of temporary workflow disruption during migration

**OPTION B: Copy Project to New Directory (Isolated Migration)**
‚úÖ Advantages:
- Complete isolation - original project remains completely untouched
- Safe experimentation with framework structure and methodology
- Easy rollback - simply delete new directory if needed
- Parallel development possible (old and new versions)
- Zero risk to existing project

‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements and Risks:
- Requires sufficient disk space for complete project copy
- Separate git repository initialization required
- Manual synchronization needed if continuing work on original
- Potential git history restart (though original history preserved)
- Need to manage two project versions during transition

**CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED:**
Please respond with EXACTLY ONE of the following:
- 'I choose Option A - Modify existing project'  
- 'I choose Option B - Copy to new directory'

**ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OR CONSTRAINTS:**
Please specify any additional requirements, constraints, or concerns you have about the migration approach.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: I cannot proceed with ANY framework implementation work until you explicitly confirm your choice. This decision affects all subsequent framework implementation."
```

##### **Choice Documentation and Validation**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Document and validate human choice
"general-purpose: Upon receiving human developer choice, document migration approach including:
1. Record chosen option (A or B) with timestamp and complete human response
2. Document any additional requirements, constraints, or concerns provided
3. Confirm understanding of implications and validate prerequisites
4. Create detailed execution plan based on chosen approach
5. Validate readiness to proceed with chosen migration strategy
Create choice documentation in .ai_context/migration_choice.md and update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with human choice completion"
```

#### **-1.3 Change Submission Protocol**

**Purpose:** Ensure clean working directory and all changes committed before framework work begins.

##### **Repository State Assessment**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Comprehensive repository state check
"general-purpose: Execute comprehensive repository state assessment including:
1. Check git working directory status for uncommitted changes
2. Identify untracked files and staging area contents
3. Verify current branch status and upstream synchronization
4. Check for pending merge operations, conflicts, or other git operations
5. Document complete repository state and readiness for migration work
Create repository state documentation in .ai_context/repository_state.md and update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with state assessment completion"
```

##### **Change Submission and Clean State Validation**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Submit all existing changes and validate clean state
"general-purpose: Execute change submission protocol including:
1. If uncommitted changes exist, create comprehensive commit message describing current project state
2. Add all modified files, new files, and changes to git staging area
3. Execute commit with descriptive message including pre-framework state
4. Push changes to remote repository if remote tracking branch exists
5. Verify completely clean working directory with no uncommitted changes
Create change submission documentation in .ai_context/change_submission.md and update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with submission completion"
```

#### **-1.4 Pre-Work Completion Validation**

**Purpose:** Validate all mandatory pre-work completed before proceeding to Phase 0.

##### **Comprehensive Pre-Work Validation**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Complete pre-work validation
"project-manager: Execute comprehensive pre-work validation including:
1. Validate migration assessment completed: project analysis, gap analysis, migration plan, risk assessment
2. Verify human developer choice documented: migration approach confirmed, requirements understood
3. Confirm change submission completed: clean working directory, all changes committed
4. Validate all .ai_context documentation created: complete project documentation
5. Generate comprehensive pre-work completion report with validation results
Create validation report in docs/validation/pre_work_completion_report.md and update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with pre-work validation completion"
```

```bash
# Final pre-work validation check
"project-manager: MANDATORY FINAL CHECK - Before proceeding to Phase 0, validate:
1. ALL pre-work requirements show COMPLETED status in .ai_context/framework_progress.md
2. Human developer explicit approval received and documented
3. Clean working directory confirmed with git status
4. All required .ai_context files exist and are complete

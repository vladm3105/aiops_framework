## **Init Framework Overview**

The Init Framework provides **complete project initialization and pre-work foundation** for AI-first development. This framework ensures project safety, framework compliance, and development readiness through systematic pre-work requirements with human supervision.

### **Core Mission**
- **Target: Project safety** through mandatory pre-work requirements and human supervision
- **Target: Framework compliance** through systematic structure validation and gap remediation  
- **AI Context Optimization** through intelligent context creation and performance configuration
- **Migration Success** through comprehensive analysis, planning, and risk mitigation
- **Human Collaboration** through critical decision points and explicit approval requirements

---

## **Init Framework Phases**

### **Phase -1: Mandatory Pre-Work Requirements (CRITICAL)**
**Purpose:** Project safety and migration preparation
- **Project Analysis**: Comprehensive discovery and compliance assessment
- **Human Decision**: Migration approach choice (REQUIRED)
- **Version Control**: Clean working directory and backup validation
- **Risk Assessment**: Complete risk analysis with mitigation strategies

**CRITICAL: ALL Phase -1 requirements must be completed before ANY framework work**

### **Phase 0: Framework Initialization & Setup**
**Purpose:** Complete Framework v3.7 structure implementation
- **Structure Creation**: Complete directory and file structure
- **AI Context Optimization**: Target <5 second loading performance
- **Development Environment**: IDE configuration and tool optimization
- **Security Foundation**: Threat modeling and security-by-design establishment

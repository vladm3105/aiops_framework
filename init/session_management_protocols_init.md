## üéØ **Init Framework Session Management Overview**

### **Init Framework Session Philosophy**

The Init Framework implements **Safety-First Session Management** that ensures:
- **Project Protection**: Complete safety validation before any structural changes
- **Human Decision Integration**: Critical decision points require explicit human approval
- **Framework Foundation**: Establishment of session management foundation for all subsequent phases
- **State Management Initialization**: Creation of `.ai_context/framework_progress.md` as single source of truth
- **Migration Safety**: Zero data loss through comprehensive pre-work requirements

### **Init Framework Session Components**

1. **TodoWrite Tool**: Real-time task management for pre-work and initialization tasks
2. **.ai_context/framework_progress.md**: Master state file creation and initialization
3. **Pre-Work Validation**: Mandatory Phase -1 requirement tracking
4. **Human Decision Tracking**: Option A vs B choice and approval documentation
5. **Framework Structure Creation**: Complete Framework v3.7 structure establishment
6. **Development Handoff Preparation**: Seamless transition to Development Framework

## üìã **Init Framework Session Protocols**

### **üöÄ Init Session Start Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Pre-Work Context Loading**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Check for existing .ai_context/framework_progress.md file
2. If file exists: Load init framework status and determine recovery action
3. If file missing: Initialize new init framework session from Phase -1
4. Load init/ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md for init framework context
5. Review init/AI_ASSISTANT_STARTUP_INIT.md for phase requirements
6. Assess current project state and initialization readiness
```

#### **Step 2: Pre-Work Status Assessment**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Validate Phase -1 pre-work completion status:
   - Migration assessment (first run only)
   - Human developer choice (Option A vs B)
   - Version control preparation and clean working directory
2. Document any incomplete pre-work requirements
3. Set session priorities based on pre-work status
4. Prepare for mandatory human interaction requirements
```

#### **Step 3: Session Safety Validation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Verify git repository status and backup readiness
2. Confirm no uncommitted changes in working directory
3. Validate version control system accessibility
4. Check project structure for existing Framework v3.7 files
5. Assess migration risks and safety procedures
```

### **‚ö° Init Session Work Protocol**

#### **Phase -1: Pre-Work Session Management**
```markdown
AI Assistant Rules:
1. **NO FRAMEWORK WORK**: Absolutely forbidden until ALL pre-work complete
2. **Human Decision Required**: Cannot proceed without Option A/B choice
3. **Safety First**: All changes must be committed before structural work
4. **Documentation Required**: Complete analysis and planning before action
5. **Validation Gates**: Each pre-work requirement must pass validation
```

#### **Real-Time Pre-Work Task Management**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **Project Analysis**: Comprehensive discovery and gap assessment
2. **Human Decision Presentation**: Option A vs B migration approach
3. **Version Control Validation**: Clean working directory confirmation
4. **Risk Assessment**: Complete risk analysis and mitigation planning
5. **Pre-Work Validation**: Comprehensive checkpoint before Phase 0
```

#### **Phase 0: Framework Initialization Session Management**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **Structure Creation**: Complete Framework v3.7 directory and file creation
2. **AI Context Setup**: Initialize .ai_context/ optimization files
3. **Security Foundation**: Establish threat model and security requirements
4. **Development Environment**: Configure IDE and development tools
5. **Integration Validation**: Ensure framework compliance and readiness
```

### **üèÅ Init Session End Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Init Completion Validation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Validate Phase -1 and Phase 0 completion status
2. Verify all mandatory pre-work requirements satisfied
3. Confirm framework structure 100% compliant with v3.7 specification
4. Validate AI context optimization configured and tested
5. Ensure development environment ready for Development Framework
```

#### **Step 2: Development Handoff Preparation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with init completion
2. Set Development Framework Phase 1 status to 'ready'
3. Create init framework handoff package with:
   - Complete project analysis and migration documentation
   - Framework structure validation reports
   - AI context optimization performance validation
   - Security foundation establishment documentation
   - Human approval records and decision documentation
```

#### **Step 3: State Transition Documentation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Archive all init session work with completion timestamps
2. Document framework foundation established for development
3. Update master state with development readiness confirmation
4. Prepare context for seamless Development Framework transition
5. Create transition audit trail for framework compliance
```

## üìä **Init Framework TodoWrite Integration**

### **Pre-Work Task Categories**

#### **Phase -1 Tasks (CRITICAL - CANNOT BE SKIPPED)**
```markdown
TodoWrite Task Types:
- **PROJECT_ANALYSIS**: Project discovery and compliance assessment
- **HUMAN_DECISION**: Migration approach choice (Option A vs B)
- **VERSION_CONTROL**: Git status validation and cleanup
- **RISK_ASSESSMENT**: Risk analysis and mitigation planning
- **PRE_WORK_VALIDATION**: Comprehensive pre-work checkpoint
```

#### **Phase 0 Tasks (Framework Initialization)**
```markdown
TodoWrite Task Types:
- **STRUCTURE_CREATION**: Framework directory and file creation
- **AI_CONTEXT_SETUP**: Context optimization and performance validation
- **SECURITY_FOUNDATION**: Threat model and security requirements
- **ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG**: Development environment setup
- **INTEGRATION_VALIDATION**: Framework compliance verification
```

### **Init Framework Status Definitions**

```markdown
Init-Specific Status Values:
- **ANALYSIS_REQUIRED**: Project analysis needed before proceeding
- **HUMAN_APPROVAL_PENDING**: Waiting for human decision or approval
- **SAFETY_VALIDATION_REQUIRED**: Version control or backup validation needed
- **STRUCTURE_CREATION_IN_PROGRESS**: Framework structure being created
- **HANDOFF_READY**: Ready for Development Framework transition
```

### **Single Focus Enforcement for Init**

```markdown
Init Framework Rules:
1. **ONE TASK RULE**: Only ONE task IN_PROGRESS during pre-work and initialization
2. **NO PARALLEL WORK**: Pre-work tasks must be completed sequentially
3. **HUMAN CHECKPOINT BLOCKING**: Cannot proceed without human approval
4. **SAFETY GATE ENFORCEMENT**: Structure work forbidden until pre-work complete
5. **VALIDATION REQUIRED**: Each task must pass validation before next task
```

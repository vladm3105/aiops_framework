### **Development & DevOps Framework Separation**

**Development Framework Output → DevOps Framework Input:**
```
Development Framework (.framework_v3.7/development/):
product.md + PRD files 
    ↓
requirements.md + EARS files + BDD files 
    ↓  
design.md + ADR files 
    ↓
tasks.md + implementation
    ↓
DEVELOPMENT OUTPUT: Deployment scripts + dev_deployment guide + dev_deployment AI tasks

                           HANDOFF POINT
                               ↓

DevOps Framework (.framework_v3.7/devops/):
DEVOPS INPUT: Deployment scripts + dev_deployment guide + dev_deployment AI tasks
    ↓
AI validation & enhancement
    ↓
Deployment execution + post-deployment testing
    ↓
DEVOPS OUTPUT: Production-ready system
```

**Clear Framework Separation:**
- **Development Framework**: Product requirements → deployment scripts preparation
- **DevOps Framework**: Artifact validation → enhancement → deployment → testing
- **Handoff Point**: Development output becomes DevOps input
- **AI Integration**: Shared AI context and patterns across both frameworks
- **Quality Assurance**: Security-by-Design and quality gates throughout both frameworks

## 🎓 **How to Run a Project with Framework v3.7 for the Very First Time**

### **Complete Human Developer Guide for First-Time Framework Implementation**

**🎯 This section provides step-by-step guidance for human developers implementing Framework v3.7 for the first time with AI assistant support.**

#### **1. Understanding the Framework Structure and Safety Requirements**

**Before starting any work:**
- Framework v3.7 is a **production-ready system** with **mandatory pre-work requirements**
- **AI assistants cannot proceed** without completing all three pre-work requirements first
- **Your project is completely protected** by version control safety measures
- **You maintain full control** over all framework decisions and changes

**Key Safety Features:**
- **Migration Assessment**: AI analyzes your project and creates a safe migration plan
- **Version Control Protection**: You choose between modifying existing files or creating a separate copy
- **Change Management**: All existing changes are committed before framework work begins
- **Human Approval Points**: AI asks for your explicit approval at every critical decision

#### **2. Preparing Your Development Environment**

**Essential Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Ensure version control is properly configured
git status  # Verify git is working
git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commit history

# Ensure you have a clean development environment
# Commit any pending changes before starting
git add .
git commit -m "Pre-framework implementation commit"
```

**Framework Files Location:**
- All framework files are in the `.framework_v3.7/` directory
- Development files: `.framework_v3.7/development/` (10 comprehensive guides)
- DevOps files: `.framework_v3.7/devops/` (6 comprehensive guides + README)
- Main files: `ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md`, `ai_prompts_workflow_v3.7.md`, `development_framework_v3.7.md`

#### **3. Starting the AI Assistant with Framework v3.7**

**Command to Initialize AI Assistant:**
```bash
# Primary command to start framework implementation
"Read and integrate the complete AI system prompt from .framework_v3.7/development/ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md ensuring full understanding of mandatory pre-work requirements, framework compliance standards, and human interaction protocols. Then begin Phase -1 mandatory pre-work requirements."
```

**Alternative Comprehensive Command:**
```bash
# Complete framework initialization command
"Initialize Framework v3.7 implementation by first reading .framework_v3.7/development/ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md and .framework_v3.7/development/ai_prompts_workflow_v3.7.md, then execute Phase -1 mandatory pre-work requirements including migration assessment, version control preparation with human choice confirmation, and change submission protocol."
```

#### **4. Responding to Mandatory Pre-Work Questions**

**🚨 The AI will ask you three critical questions that you MUST answer:**

##### **Question 1: Migration Assessment (First Run Only)**
**AI will ask:** "Should I analyze your existing project and create a migration plan?"
**Your response:** "Yes, please analyze the project structure and create a detailed migration plan with risk assessment."

##### **Question 2: Version Control Approach (Critical Decision)**
**AI will ask:** "Choose your preferred approach: Option A (modify existing files) or Option B (copy to new folder)?"

**🚨 CRITICAL DECISION: Choose Your Approach**

**Option A: Modify Existing Files in Current Project**
- ✅ **Choose this if:** You want to work directly in your current project
- ⚠️ **Requirements:** All changes will be committed to git before framework work begins
- **Your response:** "I choose Option A - Modify existing files in current project"

**Option B: Copy Project to Separated Folder**
- ✅ **Choose this if:** You want to keep original project completely untouched
- ⚠️ **Requirements:** Sufficient disk space and separate git repository
- **Your response:** "I choose Option B - Copy project to separated folder for new version"

##### **Question 3: Change Submission Confirmation**
**AI will ask:** "Should I commit all existing changes to ensure clean working directory?"
**Your response:** "Yes, please commit all changes and ensure clean working directory before proceeding."

## 🤖 AI-First DevOps Philosophy

### Core Principles for AI Assistant Operations
1. **Human-AI Collaboration**: AI assistants execute, humans supervise and approve
2. **Declarative Automation**: All operations defined in code for AI repeatability
3. **Safety-First Execution**: Multiple validation gates before production changes
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: All AI operations must generate detailed audit trails
5. **Rollback-Ready**: Every AI operation must have automated rollback capability

### AI Assistant Responsibility Matrix
```yaml
ai_assistant_responsibilities:
  - code_generation: "Generate secure, tested code following patterns"
  - test_automation: "Create comprehensive test suites (95%+ coverage)"
  - deployment_scripts: "Generate Infrastructure as Code and deployment automation"
  - monitoring_setup: "Configure observability and alerting systems"
  - security_scanning: "Run automated security validation and reporting"
  
human_supervision_points:
  - production_deployments: "Human approval required for production changes"
  - security_policy_changes: "Manual review of all security configuration"
  - database_migrations: "Human validation of schema changes"
  - infrastructure_changes: "Review of all Terraform modifications"
  - compliance_validation: "Final sign-off on NEPA compliance implementations"
```

    target_cpu        = 70
    memory_gb         = 8
    disk_type        = "SSD"
  }
}

# Core infrastructure modules
module "cara_production" {
  source = "./modules/cara-infrastructure"
  
  # AI-validated configuration
  project_id = var.project_id
  region     = var.region
  environment = var.environment
  
  # Security configuration (AI-enforced)
  security_config = local.security_validation
  
  # Performance configuration (AI-optimized)
  performance_config = local.performance_validation
  
  # Compliance configuration (AI-validated)
  nepa_compliance_enabled = true
  audit_retention_years   = 7
  
  # Cost optimization (AI-managed)
  cost_optimization_enabled = true
  committed_use_discount     = true
}
```

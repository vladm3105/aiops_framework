---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase -1: MANDATORY PRE-WORK REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING: These Requirements CANNOT be Skipped**

**Before ANY framework work begins, ALL three mandatory requirements must be completed:**

### **-1.1 Initial Project Migration Assessment (First Run Only)**
```bash
# Analyze existing project structure and create migration plan
"general-purpose: Review all existing project files and directory structure, analyze against Framework v3.7 requirements from development_framework_v3.7.md, identify gaps, dependencies, and risks, then create detailed migration plan with specific actionable tasks for transitioning to framework structure"

# Document migration risks and mitigation strategies  
"general-purpose: Document potential migration risks including data loss, structure conflicts, dependency issues, and create specific mitigation strategies for each identified risk during framework migration"

# Create step-by-step migration tasks
"general-purpose: Generate specific, actionable migration tasks in priority order including file moves, directory creation, template application, and validation steps to achieve 100% framework v3.7 compliance"
```

### **-1.2 Version Control Preparation (Every Single Run)**
```bash
# Check version control system availability
"general-purpose: Verify git, GitHub, or other version control system is available and properly configured, check current repository status and branch information"

# Ask developer for backup/versioning approach - MANDATORY HUMAN INTERACTION
"Ask human developer: Choose your preferred approach for framework implementation:
  Option A: Modify existing files in current project (requires git backup confirmation)
  Option B: Copy entire project to separated folder and create new framework version
  
  Please confirm your choice and any specific requirements before proceeding."

# Confirm developer choice and document approach
"general-purpose: Document developer's chosen approach (Option A or B), confirm backup strategy is understood and acceptable, and ensure all requirements are met before proceeding with any framework work"

# STOP POINT: Do not proceed without explicit developer confirmation
"MANDATORY STOP: Do NOT proceed with ANY framework work until developer has explicitly confirmed their choice and backup strategy. Framework work is FORBIDDEN without this confirmation."
```

### **-1.3 Change Submission Protocol (Every Single Run)**
```bash
# Check current git status and uncommitted changes
"general-purpose: Execute 'git status' to check for any uncommitted changes, untracked files, or staging area content in the current repository"

# Commit all existing changes before framework work
"general-purpose: If any uncommitted changes exist, submit ALL changes to version control system using appropriate commit messages, ensure clean working directory before framework work begins"

# Verify clean working state
"general-purpose: Verify git working directory is clean with no uncommitted changes, confirm current branch is appropriate for framework changes, document current state for rollback purposes"

# STOP POINT: Do not proceed with dirty working directory
"MANDATORY STOP: Do NOT proceed with ANY framework work if there are uncommitted changes. Framework work is FORBIDDEN with a dirty working directory."
```

### **-1.4 Pre-Work Completion Validation**
```bash
# Validate all mandatory pre-work requirements are complete

```

**IDE Configuration Integration:**
- [ ] **IDE Detection**: Automatically detect IDE from project structure and config files
- [ ] **Human Fallback**: Ask developer for IDE preference if detection fails
- [ ] **Framework Configuration**: Create IDE settings optimized for the project using framework v3.7

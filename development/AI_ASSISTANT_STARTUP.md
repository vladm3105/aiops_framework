---

## ü§ñ **AI ASSISTANT DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM INITIALIZATION**

### **CRITICAL: Load .ai_context State Management First**

**üéØ Single Source of Truth Initialization:**
```bash
# MANDATORY first action - Load master state
"general-purpose: Load .ai_context/framework_progress.md as authoritative state source and determine current development phase status, completed tasks, and next required actions for development framework"

# Validate development state integrity
"project-manager: Validate .ai_context/framework_progress.md development state including JSON syntax validation, phase consistency verification, and development framework compliance"

# Determine development recovery action
"project-manager: Based on .ai_context/framework_progress.md development state, determine appropriate recovery action - begin pre-work, resume active development task, or await human approval for phase transition"
```

### **CRITICAL: Validate Init Framework Completion**

**üö® MANDATORY PREREQUISITE VALIDATION:**
```bash
# Validate Init Framework completion before any development work
"project-manager: Validate Init Framework completion including:
1. .ai_context/framework_progress.md shows Init Framework Phase 0 completed
2. Framework v3.7 structure exists and is 100% compliant
3. Human approvals documented for migration approach and setup
4. Development Framework Phase 1 status shows 'ready'
5. All pre-work requirements completed and validated
STOP if any prerequisite fails - return to init/AI_ASSISTANT_STARTUP.md"
```

### **Development Framework Context Loading**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Initialize AI Assistant with Development Framework System Prompt
"general-purpose: Read and integrate development/ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md ensuring full understanding of development framework methodology, quality standards, and human interaction protocols"

# Load Development Framework Workflow Commands
"general-purpose: Read and integrate development/ai_prompts_workflow_v3.7.md for systematic execution of development phases with proper command sequences"

# Initialize Development Framework Context
"general-purpose: Read development/development_framework_v3.7.md for complete development methodology understanding and .ai_context/current_context.md for working state"

# Initialize Development-Specific Task Tracking
"general-purpose: Read development/ai_assistant_tasks_development.md for development task automation and update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with current development status"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è AI ASSISTANT MUST UNDERSTAND: Development work is FORBIDDEN without completing mandatory pre-work requirements**

---

## üö® **PHASE -1: MANDATORY PRE-WORK REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)**

### **AI Assistant Instructions: YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL THREE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE ANY DEVELOPMENT WORK**

#### **-1.1 Initial Project Migration Assessment (First Run Only)**

**AI Action Steps:**
1. **Project Analysis:**
```bash
# Complete project structure analysis
"general-purpose: Review all existing project files and directory structure, analyze against Framework v3.7 requirements, identify structural gaps and preservation needs, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with analysis results"
```

2. **Migration Planning:**
```bash
# Create detailed migration plan
"general-purpose: Create detailed migration plan with specific actionable tasks including file preservation, directory creation, template application, content migration, and validation procedures, document in .ai_context/framework_progress.md"
```

3. **Risk Assessment:**
```bash
# Document migration risks and mitigation
"general-purpose: Document migration risks including file conflicts, structure changes, dependencies, create mitigation strategies for each risk, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with risk assessment"
```

**AI Validation Checkpoint:**
```bash
# Update state with pre-work progress
"general-purpose: Update .ai_context/framework_progress.md Phase -1.1 completion including project analysis completed, migration plan created, risk assessment documented"
```

#### **-1.2 Version Control Preparation (Every Run)**

**AI Action Steps:**
1. **Version Control Check:**
```bash
# Verify version control availability
"general-purpose: Verify git/GitHub availability, check repository status and branch information, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with version control status"
```

2. **üö® MANDATORY AI ASSISTANT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL**

**‚ö†Ô∏è FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT:** AI assistants **MUST** start from checking the project structure and define missing files and documents before proceeding with any development work.

#### **Required AI Assistant Process (CANNOT BE SKIPPED):**

```bash
# 1. MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Project Structure Analysis
"general-purpose: Execute find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' | sort to check root framework files"
"general-purpose: Execute find docs/ -type d | sort to check documentation structure"  
"general-purpose: Execute ls -la .ai_context/ development/ deployment/ operations/ to check framework directories"

# 2. MANDATORY SECOND STEP: Framework Compliance Validation
"general-purpose: Verify all Framework v3.7 root files exist (product.md.template, requirements.md.template, design.md.template, tasks.md.template, deployment.md.template), check required directories (docs/adr/, docs/ears/, docs/bdd/, docs/prd/, docs/specs/, .ai_context/, development/), identify missing framework components and document gaps in .ai_context/framework_progress.md"

# 3. MANDATORY THIRD STEP: Gap Remediation  
"general-purpose: Create missing framework files following v3.7 specifications, populate empty required directories with appropriate content, update existing files to meet framework compliance standards, achieve 100% framework structure compliance before development tasks, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with compliance status"

# 4. ONLY AFTER 100% COMPLIANCE: Proceed with Development Tasks
"project-manager: Validate 100% framework compliance achieved before any development work begins"
```

**üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE:** AI assistants that skip project structure analysis and framework compliance validation will produce non-compliant implementations that must be rejected and restarted.

3. **MANDATORY HUMAN INTERACTION - ASK DEVELOPER:**
```
üö® CRITICAL: AI ASSISTANT MUST ASK HUMAN DEVELOPER

"Human Developer: Before I can proceed with Framework v3.7 implementation, I need your explicit choice:

Option A: Modify existing files in current project 
- Advantages: Work directly in current project, maintain git history
- Requirements: Git backup confirmation, all changes committed first

Option B: Copy project to separated folder and create new version
- Advantages: Complete isolation, original project untouched  
- Requirements: Sufficient disk space, separate git repository

Please respond with: 'I choose Option A' or 'I choose Option B'
Additional requirements: [specify any additional needs]

‚ö†Ô∏è I cannot proceed with ANY development work until you explicitly confirm your choice."
```

4. **Document Choice:**
```bash
# Document developer choice and update state
"general-purpose: Document developer's chosen approach with any additional requirements, confirm understanding of implications, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with developer choice and requirements"
```

**AI Validation Checkpoint:**
```bash
# Update state with version control preparation
"general-purpose: Update .ai_context/framework_progress.md Phase -1.2 completion including version control verified, framework compliance achieved, human developer choice documented"
```

#### **-1.3 Change Submission Protocol (Every Run)**

**AI Action Steps:**
1. **Git Status Check:**
```bash
# Check git working directory status
"general-purpose: Execute comprehensive git status to identify uncommitted changes, untracked files, staging area content, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with git status"
```

2. **Commit All Changes:**
```bash
# Commit any existing changes
"general-purpose: If uncommitted changes exist, create appropriate commit messages and submit ALL changes to version control, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with commit status"
```

3. **Verify Clean State:**
```bash
# Ensure clean working directory
"general-purpose: Verify git working directory is completely clean, confirm staging area empty, document state for rollback, update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with clean state verification"
```

**AI Validation Checkpoint:**
```bash
# Update state with change submission completion
"general-purpose: Update .ai_context/framework_progress.md Phase -1.3 completion including git status checked, all changes committed, clean working directory verified"
```

#### **-1.4 Pre-Work Completion Validation**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash
# Complete pre-work validation
"project-manager: Validate ALL three mandatory pre-work requirements completed:
‚úì Migration assessment and plan created (first run)
‚úì Developer choice confirmed and documented
‚úì All changes committed and clean working directory verified
Update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with PASS/FAIL for each requirement"
```

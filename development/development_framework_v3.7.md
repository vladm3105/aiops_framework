### **MANDATORY: Phase 3 Validated Architecture Document**

**Required for Phase 3 Completion:**
Every Phase 3 completion MUST include a validated architecture document that consolidates all architectural decisions and design components into a single implementation-ready specification.

**Validated Architecture Requirements:**
```markdown
docs/validation/validated_architecture.md Structure:
├── Executive Summary                 # Mission-critical platform overview
├── Validated System Architecture     # Complete enterprise architecture flow
├── Multi-Agent Coordination         # Agent ecosystem with performance targets
├── Data Architecture                 # Database and storage architecture
├── Security Architecture             # Complete security framework
├── Performance Architecture          # Optimization and scaling strategies
├── Integration Architecture          # External systems and APIs
├── Deployment Architecture           # Infrastructure and operations
├── Framework Compliance              # Framework v3.7 adherence validation
└── Implementation Readiness          # Technical readiness assessment
```

**Content Requirements:**
- **ADR Integration:** All architectural decisions from ADRs consolidated
- **Design Consolidation:** Complete integration with design.md architecture
- **Implementation Guidance:** Technical specifications ready for development
- **Decision Rationale:** Clear reasoning for all architectural choices
- **Performance Validation:** Confirmed targets and optimization strategies

- **Consistency:** No conflicting architectural decisions
- **Implementability:** Clear technical guidance for development teams
- **Traceability:** Complete mapping to requirements and BDD scenarios
- **Validation:** Architecture quality assessment and readiness confirmation

### **MANDATORY: Phase 4 Technical Specifications Framework**

**Required for Phase 4 Completion:**
Every Phase 4 completion MUST include detailed technical specifications using the standardized SPECS-NNNN format for all system components and implementation guidance.

**🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENT REQUIREMENT:**
Each architectural component identified in Phase 3 (Architecture & ADRs) MUST have its own dedicated technical specification. This ensures complete traceability from architectural decisions to implementation guidance and enables component-based development with clear ownership and boundaries.

**🚨 MANDATORY ONE-TO-ONE COMPONENT MAPPING:**
- **WRONG APPROACH:** Grouping multiple components into shared SPECS files (e.g., "7 API components → SPECS-0001")
- **CORRECT APPROACH:** Each individual component gets its own SPECS file (e.g., "API Gateway → SPECS-0001", "Load Balancer → SPECS-0002", "RESTful API → SPECS-0003")
- **RESULT:** If 68 architectural components are identified, then 68 individual SPECS files (SPECS-0001 through SPECS-0068) must be created

**🚨 MANDATORY PRE-PHASE 4 REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Architectural Component Identification:** Create complete architectural component mapping document that identifies ALL components from Phase 3 validated architecture and design.md. This document ensures 100% component coverage and proper one-to-one assignment to individual SPECS documents.

**🔥 CRITICAL MAPPING REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Individual Component Analysis:** Each architectural element (service, database, agent, API endpoint, security layer, etc.) must be identified as a separate component
- **One-to-One Mapping:** Each component maps to exactly one SPECS-NNNN file 
- **Sequential Numbering:** SPECS-0001, SPECS-0002, SPECS-0003... up to SPECS-[TOTAL_COMPONENTS]
- **No Component Grouping:** Never group multiple components into a single SPECS file
- **Product Phase Prioritization:** Components must be prioritized using product release phases (MVP, V1, V2, V3) instead of technical priorities for stakeholder clarity

**📋 PRODUCT PHASE PRIORITY SYSTEM:**
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Core life-safety functionality essential for initial deployment
- **V1 (Version 1):** Enhanced capabilities for full operational deployment
- **V2 (Version 2):** Advanced intelligence and optimization features  
- **V3 (Version 3):** Enterprise scalability and advanced compliance features

2. **SPECS Document List Creation:** After identifying all architectural components, create a complete list of ALL required SPECS-NNNN documents with their individual component assignments, priorities, and coverage scope. This list serves as the master plan for Phase 4 implementation.

**Product Phase-Driven Specifications Structure:**
```markdown
docs/specs/
├── ARCHITECTURAL_COMPONENT_MAPPING.md         # Maps all 79 components to Product Phases
├── SPECS_DOCUMENT_LIST.md                     # Master plan for selected Product Phase
└── [SELECTED PRODUCT PHASE SPECS]/
    ├── SPECS-NNNN-[component-name].md         # Each component gets individual SPECS file
    ├── SPECS-NNNN-[component-name].md         # SPECS numbers from mapping document
    └── ...                                    # Only components for selected Product Phase

## 🤖 **Phase 4: AI-First Development Implementation**

### 🚨 **MANDATORY AI ASSISTANT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL**

**⚠️ FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT:** AI assistants **MUST** start from checking the project structure at first and define the missing files and documents in respect with the framework before proceeding with any development work.

#### **Required AI Assistant Process (CANNOT BE SKIPPED):**

1. **Project Structure Analysis (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
   ```bash
   # AI assistants MUST execute this analysis first
   find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | sort  # Check root framework files
   find docs/ -type d | sort               # Check documentation structure  
   ls -la .ai_context/ development/ deployment/ operations/ 2>/dev/null  # Check framework directories
   ```

2. **Framework Compliance Validation (MANDATORY SECOND STEP)**
   - Verify all Framework v3.7 root files exist: product.md, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, deployment.md
   - Check required directories: docs/adr/, docs/ears/, docs/bdd/, docs/prd/, docs/specs/, .ai_context/, deployment/
   - Identify missing framework components and document gaps
   - Create compliance status report before proceeding

3. **Gap Remediation (MANDATORY THIRD STEP)**
   - Create missing framework files following v3.7 specifications
   - Populate empty required directories with appropriate content
   - Update existing files to meet framework compliance standards
   - Achieve 100% framework structure compliance before development tasks

4. **Only After 100% Compliance: Proceed with Development Tasks**
   - Begin phase-specific implementation only after framework compliance achieved
   - Follow systematic development approach with human oversight
   - Maintain framework compliance throughout all development activities

**🚨 VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE:** AI assistants that skip project structure analysis and framework compliance validation will produce non-compliant implementations that must be rejected and restarted.**

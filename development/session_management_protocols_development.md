## 📋 **Development Framework Session Protocols**

### **🚀 Development Session Start Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Development Context Loading**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Load .ai_context/framework_progress.md and validate Init Framework completion
2. Confirm Development Framework Phase 1 status shows 'ready'
3. Load development/ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md for development context
4. Review development/AI_ASSISTANT_STARTUP.md for phase requirements
5. Load Init Framework handoff package and project context
6. Initialize development-specific AI context and optimization
```

#### **Step 2: Phase-Specific Context Initialization**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Determine current development phase (1-6) from master state
2. Load phase-specific requirements and deliverables
3. Review previous phase completion and human approvals
4. Set session priorities based on current phase objectives
5. Prepare multi-agent coordination for development tasks
```

#### **Step 3: Development Environment Validation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Verify development environment configuration from Init Framework
2. Validate Framework v3.7 structure compliance
3. Confirm AI context optimization performance (<5 second loading)
4. Check security foundation and development requirements
5. Ensure all development prerequisites satisfied
```

#### **Phase-Specific Session Management**

##### **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Specification**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **Business Vision Creation**: Product.md and PRD development
2. **EARS Requirements**: Formal requirements in WHEN-THE-SHALL-WITHIN format
3. **Requirements Validation**: Completeness and traceability verification
4. **Human Approval Gate**: Requirements review and approval checkpoint
```

##### **Phase 2: Behavioral Specification & BDD Development**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **Core System BDD**: Given-When-Then scenarios for all requirements
2. **Security BDD**: Security behavior validation scenarios
3. **Performance BDD**: Performance requirement validation scenarios
4. **BDD Coverage Analysis**: 100% requirements coverage validation
```

##### **Phase 3: Architecture & ADR Development**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **System Architecture**: Technical architecture design and documentation
2. **ADR Creation**: Architecture Decision Records with rationale
3. **Security Architecture**: Security-by-design architecture integration
4. **Validated Architecture**: Implementation-ready consolidated specification
```

##### **Phase 4: Technical Specifications & Deployment Strategy**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **Component Mapping**: Architectural component to specification mapping
2. **SPECS Development**: Detailed SPECS-NNNN technical specifications
3. **Implementation Planning**: Product phase selection and roadmap
4. **Deployment Preparation**: Deployment strategy and infrastructure planning
```

##### **Phase 5: Implementation & Coding**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **Core Implementation**: System functionality following specifications
2. **Security Implementation**: Security controls and validation
3. **Performance Implementation**: Performance optimization and scalability
4. **Integration Implementation**: External system integrations
```

##### **Phase 6: Testing & Quality Assurance**
```markdown
AI Assistant Workflow:
1. **BDD Testing**: All BDD scenarios executed and validated
2. **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security validation
3. **Performance Testing**: Performance targets validated
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end system validation
```

### **🏁 Development Session End Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Phase Completion Validation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Validate current phase deliverables complete and quality-assured
2. Execute comprehensive phase validation report generation
3. Confirm all phase requirements satisfied per framework methodology
4. Prepare phase completion documentation for human review
5. Update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with phase status
```

#### **Step 2: Human Approval Preparation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Create comprehensive phase review package:
   - Phase deliverables summary and validation
   - Quality metrics and compliance verification
   - Next phase prerequisites and readiness assessment
   - Risk assessment and mitigation for next phase
2. Present phase completion for human approval
3. Document approval status and any modification requirements
```

#### **Step 3: Phase Transition Management**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Archive completed phase work with validation reports
2. Update master state with phase completion and approval
3. Set next phase status to 'ready' (or 'deployment_ready' after Phase 6)
4. Prepare context and handoff for next phase or framework transition
5. Maintain development velocity metrics and effectiveness tracking

## 📋 **Framework v3.7 BDD Structure**

This guide explains how to effectively integrate BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) behavioral scenarios with technical specifications to create executable, validated, and maintainable AI agent systems that comply with Framework v3.7 standards.

## Integration Approach

BDD scenarios bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation by:

1. **Translating EARS requirements into executable behaviors**
2. **Providing validation criteria for technical implementations**
3. **Creating a shared language between stakeholders and developers**
4. **Enabling automated testing of agent behaviors**

## Core Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: EARS Requirement → BDD Scenario → Technical Implementation

This is the fundamental pattern that connects business requirements to technical code through behavioral scenarios.

#### EARS Requirement (requirements.md.template)

```markdown
REQ-001: WHEN a user requests fire danger analysis for a location 
THE fire risk agent SHALL return ASCII visualization and risk assessment 
WITHIN 8 seconds

- Acceptance Criteria: Response time < 8 seconds, valid ASCII format, accurate risk level
- Validation Method: Performance testing + behavioral scenario validation
```

#### BDD Scenario (specs/fire_agent_specs.md)

```gherkin
Feature: Fire Danger Analysis
As a fire management specialist, I want real-time fire danger analysis so that I can make informed decisions.

Scenario: Successful fire danger query
Given the fire risk agent is operational
And weather data is available for "BRIMSTONE RESERVOIR"
When I request fire danger analysis for "BRIMSTONE RESERVOIR"
Then I should receive an ASCII fire danger visualization within 8 seconds
And the response should include current fire danger level
And the ASCII format should be properly structured
And the risk assessment should be based on current NFDRS data
```

#### Technical Implementation

```python
# This scenario validates the technical implementation
class FireRiskAgent:
    async def analyze_fire_danger(self, location: str) -> FireDangerResponse:
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Technical implementation here
        weather_data = await self.weather_service.get_current_data(location)
        nfdrs_data = await self.calculate_nfdrs_metrics(weather_data)
        ascii_viz = self.generate_ascii_visualization(nfdrs_data)
        
        response_time = time.time() - start_time
        assert response_time < 8.0  # BDD scenario requirement
        
        return FireDangerResponse(
            ascii_visualization=ascii_viz,
            risk_level=nfdrs_data.risk_level,
            response_time=response_time
        )
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Agent Coordination Scenarios

This pattern validates complex multi-agent interactions through behavioral scenarios.

#### Design Specification (design.md.template)

```markdown
## Parallel Execution Pattern
- When to Use: Real-time fire danger analysis requiring weather + satellite data
- Implementation Approach: Async parallel agent coordination
- Communication Protocol: Event-driven message passing
- Performance Monitoring: Sub-5 second total response time
```

#### BDD Scenario (specs/coordination_specs.md)

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Agent Fire Analysis Coordination
As a system, I need to coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive fire analysis.

Scenario: Parallel weather and satellite data analysis
Given the weather agent is ready
And the satellite detection agent is ready
And the fire analysis coordinator is operational
When a fire danger analysis is requested for coordinates "45.7,-110.4"
Then the coordinator should dispatch requests to both agents in parallel
And the weather agent should return atmospheric conditions within 3 seconds
And the satellite agent should return fire detection data within 3 seconds
And the coordinator should combine results within 5 seconds total
And the final response should include both weather and satellite insights
```

#### Technical Implementation

```python
class FireAnalysisCoordinator:
    async def coordinate_analysis(self, coordinates: tuple) -> CombinedAnalysis:
        # BDD scenario drives this coordination pattern
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Parallel execution as specified in BDD scenario
        weather_task = asyncio.create_task(
            self.weather_agent.analyze(coordinates)
        )
        satellite_task = asyncio.create_task(
            self.satellite_agent.detect_fires(coordinates)
        )
        
        # Wait for both with timeout validation
        weather_data, satellite_data = await asyncio.gather(
            weather_task, satellite_task, timeout=3.0
        )
        
        # Combine results within total time constraint
        combined_analysis = self.combine_analysis(weather_data, satellite_data)
        
        total_time = time.time() - start_time
        assert total_time < 5.0  # BDD scenario requirement
        
        return combined_analysis
```

### Pattern 3: Error Handling Scenarios

This pattern ensures robust error handling through behavioral validation.

#### EARS Requirement

```markdown
REQ-005: WHEN external data sources are unavailable 
THE system SHALL provide degraded fire analysis using cached data 
WITH clear indication of data staleness
```

#### BDD Scenario

```gherkin
Scenario: Graceful degradation with stale data
Given the fire risk agent is operational
And external weather services are unavailable
And cached weather data exists from 2 hours ago
When I request fire danger analysis for "PINE RIDGE"
Then the system should use cached data for analysis
And the response should include a data staleness warning
And the ASCII visualization should indicate "DEGRADED MODE"
And the analysis should complete within 8 seconds
And the risk assessment should be marked as "ESTIMATED"
```

#### Technical Implementation

```python
class FireRiskAgent:
    async def analyze_with_fallback(self, location: str) -> FireDangerResponse:
        try:
            # Try current data first
            weather_data = await self.weather_service.get_current_data(location)
        except WeatherServiceUnavailable:
            # BDD scenario: use cached data with warnings
            weather_data = await self.cache.get_latest_weather(location)
            if weather_data.age_hours > 1:
                return FireDangerResponse(
                    ascii_visualization=self.generate_degraded_viz(weather_data),
                    risk_level=f"ESTIMATED ({weather_data.age_hours}h old)",
                    mode="DEGRADED",
                    warnings=["Weather data may be outdated"]
                )
```

### Pattern 4: Performance Scenario Validation

This pattern validates system performance under various load conditions.

#### BDD Scenario

```gherkin
Scenario: High-load fire analysis performance
Given 100 concurrent users are requesting fire analysis
And the system is under normal operational load
When all users submit requests simultaneously
Then 95% of requests should complete within 8 seconds
And no requests should fail due to system overload
And resource utilization should remain below 80%
```

#### Technical Implementation

```python
# Technical implementation with performance monitoring
class PerformanceValidator:
    async def validate_concurrent_load(self):
        """Validate system meets BDD performance scenarios"""
        tasks = [
            self.fire_agent.analyze_fire_danger(f"location_{i}")
            for i in range(100)
        ]
        
        start_time = time.time()
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        
        # Validate BDD scenario requirements
        successful_results = [r for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception)]
        completion_times = [r.response_time for r in successful_results]
        
        assert len(successful_results) == 100  # No failures
        assert percentile(completion_times, 95) < 8.0  # 95% under 8 seconds
```

## BDD-Technical Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Requirement Analysis

```text
EARS Requirement → Identify behaviors → Define scenarios → Technical constraints
```

**Process:**
1. Extract behavioral aspects from EARS requirements
2. Identify stakeholder interactions and system responses
3. Define measurable outcomes and performance constraints
4. Map to technical implementation patterns

### Step 2: Scenario Development

```gherkin
# Start with business value
Feature: [Business capability]
As a [stakeholder], I want [capability] so that [business outcome]

# Define normal behavior
Scenario: [Happy path behavior]
Given [preconditions matching technical constraints]
When [action that triggers technical implementation]
Then [expected outcome that validates technical behavior]

# Define error behaviors  
Scenario: [Error handling behavior]
Given [failure conditions matching technical error cases]
When [error trigger that technical system must handle]
Then [expected recovery behavior that technical system implements]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use domain-specific language that both business and technical teams understand
- Include performance constraints from EARS requirements
- Cover both normal and exceptional behaviors
- Specify measurable outcomes that can be automatically validated

### Step 3: Technical Implementation

```python
# Test-driven development using BDD scenarios
def test_fire_danger_analysis_scenario():
    """Technical test implementing BDD scenario"""
    # Given: Set up technical preconditions from scenario
    agent = FireRiskAgent()
    weather_service = MockWeatherService(data=valid_weather_data)
    
    # When: Execute technical action from scenario
    result = await agent.analyze_fire_danger("BRIMSTONE RESERVOIR")
    
    # Then: Validate technical outcomes match scenario expectations
    assert result.response_time < 8.0  # Performance requirement
    assert "ASCII" in result.visualization  # Format requirement
    assert result.risk_level in ["LOW", "MODERATE", "HIGH", "EXTREME"]  # Domain requirement
```

**Implementation Principles:**
- Each BDD scenario step maps to specific technical validation
- Performance constraints become automated assertions
- Error scenarios drive exception handling patterns
- Multi-agent scenarios validate coordination protocols

### Step 4: Validation Framework

```python
class BDDTechnicalValidator:
    def validate_scenario_against_implementation(self, scenario_id: str, implementation):
        """Ensure technical implementation satisfies BDD scenario"""
        scenario = self.load_scenario(scenario_id)
        
        # Execute scenario steps against technical implementation
        for step in scenario.steps:
            if step.type == "given":
                self.setup_preconditions(step, implementation)
            elif step.type == "when":
                result = self.execute_action(step, implementation)
            elif step.type == "then":
                self.validate_outcome(step, result, implementation)
        
        return self.generate_validation_report()
```

## Practical Integration Guidelines

### For Requirements Analysis

1. **Extract Behaviors from EARS Requirements:**
   - Identify trigger conditions (WHEN clauses)
   - Map system responses (SHALL clauses)
   - Include performance constraints (WITHIN clauses)
   - Consider error conditions and fallback behaviors

2. **Create Scenario Hierarchies:**
   - Feature-level scenarios for major capabilities
   - Component-level scenarios for individual agents
   - Integration scenarios for multi-agent coordination
   - Error scenarios for failure modes

### For Scenario Writing

1. **Use Consistent Language:**
   - Match domain terminology from requirements
   - Use measurable, testable assertions
   - Include performance and quality constraints
   - Specify exact expected behaviors

2. **Structure for Technical Implementation:**
   - Given steps set up technical preconditions
   - When steps trigger specific technical actions
   - Then steps validate technical outcomes
   - And/But steps provide additional validation

### For Technical Implementation

1. **Map Scenarios to Code:**
   - Each scenario becomes an automated test
   - Performance assertions validate timing requirements
   - Error scenarios drive exception handling
   - Integration scenarios validate coordination

2. **Maintain Traceability:**
   - Link code to specific scenarios
   - Document scenario coverage in tests
   - Update scenarios when behavior changes
   - Validate scenario execution in CI/CD

## Advanced Integration Techniques

### Scenario-Driven Architecture

Use BDD scenarios to drive architectural decisions:

```gherkin
Scenario: Agent failover during high load
Given the primary fire analysis agent is overloaded
And backup agents are available
When analysis requests exceed capacity threshold
Then the system should automatically route requests to backup agents
And response times should remain under 8 seconds
And users should not experience service interruption
```

This scenario drives technical decisions about:
- Load balancing architecture
- Agent scaling patterns
- Failover mechanisms
- Performance monitoring

### Dynamic Scenario Validation

Create scenarios that validate runtime behavior:

```python
class RuntimeScenarioValidator:
    def validate_coordination_pattern(self, pattern_name: str):
        """Validate multi-agent coordination against BDD scenarios in production"""
        scenario = self.get_coordination_scenario(pattern_name)
        
        # Monitor actual agent behavior
        coordination_trace = self.monitor_agent_coordination()
        
        # Validate against scenario expectations
        return self.validate_trace_against_scenario(coordination_trace, scenario)
```

### Scenario-Based Configuration

Use scenarios to configure system behavior:

```yaml
# Configuration driven by BDD scenarios
fire_analysis_config:
  response_time_target: 8_seconds  # From BDD scenario
  parallel_agent_timeout: 3_seconds  # From coordination scenario
  degraded_mode_threshold: 2_hours  # From error handling scenario
  concurrent_request_limit: 100  # From performance scenario
```

## Benefits of BDD-Technical Integration

### 1. Executable Specifications
- BDD scenarios become automated tests that validate technical implementation
- Requirements are continuously validated against actual system behavior
- Changes that break business requirements are immediately detected

### 2. Shared Understanding
- Business stakeholders and technical teams use same behavioral descriptions
- Reduces miscommunication between requirements and implementation
- Provides clear acceptance criteria for all stakeholders

### 3. Continuous Validation
- Technical changes are automatically validated against business scenarios
- Regression testing ensures behavior remains consistent
- Performance requirements are continuously monitored

### 4. Documentation Synchronization
- BDD scenarios document both business intent and technical behavior
- Living documentation that stays current with implementation
- Clear traceability from requirements to code

### 5. Regression Prevention
- Changes that break scenarios are immediately detected
- Behavior changes require explicit scenario updates
- Technical debt is visible through failing scenarios

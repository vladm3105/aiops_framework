# Glossary

This document provides a glossary of key terms and concepts used in the AI Agent Development Framework v3.7.

## AI-First Methodology

An approach to software development where AI assistants are the primary drivers of the development process. Humans provide strategic oversight and approval at key checkpoints, but the AI assistants perform the majority of the development tasks.

## Specification-Driven Development

A development process that is driven by a series of documents that define the requirements, design, and implementation of the application. This ensures that the development process is well-documented and that the final product meets the specified requirements.

## EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

A format for writing requirements in a clear and concise way. The EARS format is designed to be easy for both humans and machines to understand.

## BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

A software development process that is based on the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). In BDD, you write behavioral scenarios that describe how the application should behave from the user's perspective. These scenarios are then used to drive the development of the application.

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

A document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## SPECS-NNNN format

A format for writing technical specifications. The SPECS-NNNN format is designed to be easy for both humans and machines to understand.

## [Project Name] enterprise agentic AI platform

A platform for building and deploying enterprise-grade AI agents. The platform provides a set of tools and services that make it easy to build, train, and deploy AI agents.

## TodoWrite Tool

A tool for managing tasks in a real-time, collaborative environment. The TodoWrite tool is used to manage the tasks in the AI Agent Development Framework v3.7.

# Validate or create validation framework state
"project-manager: Validate or initialize .ai_context/framework_progress.md validation framework state including deployment handoff status, validation requirements completion, and validation framework compliance preparation"

# Determine validation recovery action
"project-manager: Based on .ai_context/framework_progress.md validation state, determine appropriate validation action - begin infrastructure validation, resume active validation task, or proceed with operations handoff"
```

### **Validation Framework Context Loading**

**AI Action Steps:**
```bash

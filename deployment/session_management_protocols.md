## **Deployment Framework Session Protocols**

### **Deployment Session Start Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Development Handoff Validation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Load .ai_context/framework_progress.md and validate Development Framework completion
2. Confirm Development Framework Phase 6 completion with human approval
3. Load deployment/ai_system_prompt_v3.7.md for deployment context
4. Review deployment/AI_ASSISTANT_STARTUP.md for requirements
5. Process Development Framework handoff package and validate deliverables
6. Initialize deployment-specific AI context and automation
```

#### **Step 2: Infrastructure Requirements Analysis**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Analyze development artifacts for infrastructure requirements
2. Process technical specifications for deployment architecture
3. Validate security requirements and compliance needs
4. Assess performance requirements and scaling needs

### **üèÅ Deployment Session End Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Deployment Completion Validation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Validate production deployment successful with all systems operational
2. Execute comprehensive deployment validation and performance verification
3. Confirm all security controls active and compliance requirements satisfied
4. Validate monitoring and observability systems operational
5. Generate deployment completion report with metrics and validation
```

#### **Step 2: Operations Handoff Preparation**
```markdown
AI Assistant Actions:
1. Update .ai_context/framework_progress.md with deployment completion
2. Set Operations Framework Phase 8 status to 'ready'
3. Create deployment handoff package for operations:
   - Production system configuration and documentation
   - Monitoring and observability setup documentation
   - Performance baseline and optimization configuration
   - Security controls and compliance validation
   - Incident response and operational procedures
```

#### **Step 3: Production Operations Transition**

## 🔵 **Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**

### **Blue-Green Architecture Overview**
Blue-Green deployment provides **zero-downtime deployments** by maintaining two identical production environments:

- **Blue Environment:** Current production serving live traffic
- **Green Environment:** New version deployed and validated  
- **Instant Switch:** Traffic switched from Blue to Green instantaneously
- **Immediate Rollback:** Quick rollback by switching traffic back to Blue

### **Google Cloud Platform Blue-Green**

#### **Cloud Run Blue-Green Configuration**

- **Health Check Integration**: Comprehensive liveness and readiness probes with configurable timeouts and intervals

**Service Configuration Patterns:**
- **Blue Service**: Production-ready service serving live traffic with standard auto-scaling configuration
- **Green Service**: Deployment target service initially scaled to zero, activated during deployment process

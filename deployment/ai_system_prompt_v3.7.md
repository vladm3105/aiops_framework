## üìã **Deployment Framework Context Loading Protocol**

### **Critical Pre-Deployment Requirements (MANDATORY)**

**Before ANY Deployment framework work begins, the AI assistant MUST:**

#### **1. Initial Development Handoff Assessment** ü§ñ AI AUTONOMOUS
For very first initial run with development artifacts:
- **Review Development Artifacts**: Analyze all deployment scripts, infrastructure requirements, and AI tasks
- **Gap Analysis**: Compare development artifacts against Deployment Framework v3.7 requirements  
- **Deployment Plan**: Create detailed deployment plan with tasks to achieve production readiness
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Identify specific improvements for production deployment
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential deployment risks and dependencies

#### **2. Mandatory Version Control Preparation** üë§ HUMAN SUPERVISION REQUIRED
Before every single run of deployment framework work:
- **Version Control Check**: Verify git, GitHub, or other version control system is available
- **Deployment Strategy**: Ask human developer to choose:
  - **Option A**: Modify existing deployment configuration in current project (with git backup)
  - **Option B**: Copy project to separated folder and create new deployment version
- **Developer Confirmation**: Obtain explicit confirmation from human developer on chosen approach and preferred deployment strategy
- **No Work Without Approval**: Do NOT proceed with any changes until developer confirms approach

#### **3. Mandatory Change Submission Protocol**  
Before every single run of deployment framework work:
- **Git Status Verification**: Check current git status and any uncommitted changes
- **Pre-Work Commit**: Submit all existing changes to version control system before starting
- **Clean Working State**: Ensure clean git working directory before deployment framework work begins
- **Branch Strategy**: Confirm appropriate branch for deployment framework changes
- **No Work on Dirty State**: Do NOT proceed if there are uncommitted changes

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING: NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS**

**These pre-deployment requirements are MANDATORY and CANNOT be skipped:**

- **NEVER start deployment framework work without completing ALL three pre-work requirements**
- **NEVER proceed without explicit developer confirmation on deployment strategy**  
- **NEVER work with uncommitted changes in the repository**
- **ALWAYS create deployment plan before any deployment changes (first run)**
- **ALWAYS respect developer choice on backup/versioning strategy**

**Violation of these requirements may result in:**
- Production deployment failures or downtime
- Deployment configuration corruption  
- Loss of deployment history
- Deployment framework implementation failures

### **Deployment Framework Context Initialization (Target: <5 seconds)**

#### **STEP 1: Load Master State (MANDATORY)**
```bash
# Primary state recovery - Single Source of Truth
"general-purpose: Load .ai_context/framework_progress.md as authoritative state source and determine current deployment phase status, completed development handoff, and next required deployment actions"
```

#### **STEP 2: State Recovery Validation**
```bash
# Validate deployment readiness state
"project-manager: Validate .ai_context/framework_progress.md deployment state including Phase 7 status, development handoff completion, and deployment framework compliance"
```

#### **STEP 3: Determine Deployment Action**
```bash
# Execute deployment state-based recovery
"cloud-devops-expert: Based on .ai_context/framework_progress.md deployment state, determine appropriate deployment action - begin deployment preparation, resume active deployment task, or execute production deployment"
```

### **Deployment Context Loading (After State Recovery)**

After state recovery completion, load deployment context based on current phase:

1. **Load Deployment Framework Methodology**: Read `deployment_framework_v3.7.md` for complete deployment methodology
2. **Check Project Instructions**: Check `.instructions/` directory (if exists) for project-specific guidance and constraints
3. **Load Deployment Context**: Read `.ai_context/deployment_patterns.md` for deployment patterns and practices
4. **Load Infrastructure Context**: Read `.ai_context/infrastructure_context.md` for infrastructure intelligence
5. **Load Testing Context**: Read `.ai_context/testing_strategies.md` for testing automation approaches
6. **Load Security Context**: Read deployment security configurations and compliance requirements

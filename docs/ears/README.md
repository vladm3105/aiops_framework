# EARS Format Requirements
## AI Agent Development Framework v3.7 - EARS Directory

**Purpose**: EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format requirements specification  
**Format**: WHEN [trigger] THE [system] SHALL [response] WITHIN [performance criteria]  
**Integration**: Links to [`../requirements.md.template`](../../requirements.md.template) for master requirements overview

## ðŸ“‹ **EARS Overview**

EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) provides a structured approach to writing clear, testable requirements for the AI Agent Development Framework v3.7.

### **EARS Format Template**
```markdown
**WHEN** [optional preconditions or trigger]  
**THE** [system or component]  
**SHALL** [required response or behavior]  
**WITHIN** [performance criteria, constraints, or quality measures]
```

### **EARS Categories**
- **Functional Requirements**: System behavior and capabilities
- **Performance Requirements**: Speed, throughput, and efficiency criteria
- **Security Requirements**: Security controls and compliance measures
- **Usability Requirements**: User experience and accessibility criteria
- **Reliability Requirements**: Availability, fault tolerance, and recovery

## ðŸ”— **Requirements Traceability**

### **Requirements to Design Mapping**
Each EARS requirement traces to specific design components:
- **Architecture Decisions**: ADRs documenting how requirements are addressed
- **Technical Specifications**: Detailed SPECS documents implementing requirements
- **BDD Scenarios**: Behavioral tests validating requirement satisfaction
- **Validation Reports**: Evidence of requirement fulfillment

### **Traceability Matrix**
| EARS ID | Requirement | Design Component | Specification | BDD Scenario | Validation |
|---------|-------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| FR-001 | Lifecycle Coverage | ADR-002 | SPECS-001 | BDD-001 | VAL-001 |
| FR-002 | AI-Autonomous Ops | ADR-005 | SPECS-002 | BDD-002 | VAL-002 |
| NFR-001 | Performance | ADR-010 | SPECS-010 | BDD-010 | VAL-010 |
| SR-001 | Security-by-Design | ADR-004 | SPECS-020 | BDD-020 | VAL-020 |

## âœ… **EARS Management Process**

### **Requirements Development**
1. **Identify Need**: Recognize requirement for system capability or constraint
2. **Draft EARS**: Create requirement using EARS format template
3. **Validate Testability**: Ensure requirement can be objectively verified
4. **Review Process**: Stakeholder review for completeness and clarity
5. **Accept Requirement**: Approve requirement for implementation

### **Requirements Validation**
- **Design Review**: Verify requirements addressed in system design
- **Implementation Review**: Confirm requirements implemented in code
- **Testing Validation**: Validate requirements through BDD scenarios
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define measurable success criteria for each requirement

### **Requirements Management**
- **Version Control**: All EARS requirements under version control
- **Change Management**: Structured process for requirement modifications
- **Impact Analysis**: Assess impact of requirement changes on system design
- **Traceability Maintenance**: Keep traceability matrix current and accurate

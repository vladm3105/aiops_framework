# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
## AI Agent Development Framework v3.7 - ADR Directory

**Purpose**: Architecture Decision Records document significant architectural decisions made during framework implementation  
**Format**: Standard ADR format with context, decision, rationale, and consequences  
**Integration**: Links to [`../templates/framework/design.md.template`](../../templates/framework/design.md.template) for overall architecture overview

## ðŸ“‹ **ADR Overview**

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide a structured way to document architectural decisions, their rationale, and their implications for the AI Agent Development Framework v3.7.

### **ADR Format Template**
Each ADR follows this standardized format:
```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: [Decision Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [List of decision makers]

## Context
[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision
[State the decision made]

## Rationale
[Explain why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[Describe positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[List alternatives that were considered]
```

## ðŸ”— **ADR Relationships**

### **Cross-Framework Integration**
- **Init Framework**: ADRs affecting project initialization and setup
- **Development Framework**: ADRs impacting development methodology and processes
- **Deployment Framework**: ADRs related to infrastructure and deployment strategies
- **Operations Framework**: ADRs concerning operational excellence and monitoring

### **Technical Dependencies**
- **System Architecture**: All ADRs must align with overall system architecture
- **Security Requirements**: Security ADRs provide foundation for all framework phases
- **Performance Requirements**: Performance ADRs establish targets for framework execution
- **Compliance Requirements**: Compliance ADRs ensure regulatory adherence

## âœ… **ADR Management Process**

### **Creating New ADRs**
1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize need for architectural decision documentation
2. **Research Context**: Gather relevant information and stakeholder input
3. **Propose Decision**: Create ADR with proposed status for review
4. **Review Process**: Stakeholder review and discussion of decision
5. **Accept Decision**: Update status to accepted and implement decision

### **ADR Lifecycle**
- **Proposed**: Decision under consideration and review
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer relevant or applicable
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer ADR

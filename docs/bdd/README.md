## ðŸ“‹ **BDD Overview**

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) scenarios provide executable specifications that validate the AI Agent Development Framework v3.7 requirements through behavioral testing.

### **BDD Format Template**
```gherkin

  I want [goal/desire]
  So that [benefit/value]

  Background:
    Given [common preconditions]

  Scenario: [Scenario Name]
    Given [initial context]
    When [action or event]
    Then [expected outcome]
    And [additional verification]
```

### **BDD Categories**
- **Core System BDD**: Core framework functionality and behavior
- **Security BDD**: Security controls and compliance validation
- **Performance BDD**: Performance targets and optimization validation
- **Integration BDD**: Inter-framework integration and handoff validation

## ðŸ“š **BDD Scenarios Index**

### **Core System BDD**

#### **Framework Lifecycle BDD**
**File**: [core-system-lifecycle.feature](core-system-lifecycle.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: Complete Framework Lifecycle
  As a development team
  I want complete lifecycle coverage through all framework phases
  So that I can deliver software from conception to operations

  Scenario: Successful framework phase progression
    Given the AI Agent Development Framework v3.7 is initialized
    When all four phases are executed sequentially
    Then Init â†’ Development â†’ Deployment â†’ Operations workflow completes successfully
    And each phase handoff includes complete validation and human approval
```

#### **AI-Autonomous Operations BDD**
**File**: [core-system-ai-autonomous.feature](core-system-ai-autonomous.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: AI-Autonomous Framework Operations
  As a development team
  I want AI-autonomous task execution with human supervision
  So that I achieve 10x development velocity with quality assurance

  Scenario: AI agent task execution with human oversight
    Given specialized AI agents are available for framework tasks
    When a framework phase requires task execution
    Then 90-95% of tasks are completed autonomously by AI agents
    And 5-10% of critical decisions require human approval
    And all agent outputs are validated through framework quality gates
```

### **Security BDD**

#### **Security-by-Design BDD**
**File**: [security-by-design.feature](security-by-design.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: Security-by-Design Integration
  As a security-conscious development team
  I want security integrated throughout all framework phases
  So that security is built-in rather than bolt-on

  Scenario: Security controls integrated in development phase
    Given the Development Framework is active
    When architecture and implementation phases are executed
    Then threat modeling is completed during architecture design
    And security controls are implemented during coding phase
    And security testing is included in BDD validation
    And security validation passes before deployment handoff
```

#### **Compliance Validation BDD**
**File**: [security-compliance.feature](security-compliance.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: Regulatory Compliance Validation
  As a compliance officer
  I want automated compliance validation throughout development
  So that regulatory requirements are satisfied continuously

  Scenario: Regulatory compliance validation
    Given environmental compliance requirements apply to the project
    When deployment framework provisions infrastructure
    Then regulatory compliance checks are executed automatically
    And compliance documentation is generated and validated
    And non-compliant deployments are blocked automatically
```

### **Performance BDD**

#### **Development Velocity BDD**
**File**: [performance-development-velocity.feature](performance-development-velocity.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: 10x Development Velocity Achievement
  As a development team
  I want AI-accelerated development with framework methodology
  So that development velocity improves by 10x over traditional approaches

  Scenario: Development velocity measurement and validation
    Given baseline development metrics are established
    When framework methodology is applied to software development
    Then development velocity increases by at least 10x
    And quality metrics show >95% defect reduction
    And development team satisfaction increases significantly
```

#### **System Availability BDD**
**File**: [performance-system-availability.feature](performance-system-availability.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: High Availability System Operations
  As an operations team
  I want >99.9% system availability through AI-autonomous operations
  So that business continuity is maintained with minimal human intervention

  Scenario: System availability monitoring and maintenance
    Given systems are deployed using framework methodology
    When AI-autonomous operations are active
    Then system availability exceeds 99.9% uptime
    And mean time to recovery (MTTR) is less than 2 minutes
    And 95% of operational tasks are handled autonomously
    And human intervention is only required for strategic decisions
```

### **Integration BDD**

#### **Framework Phase Integration BDD**
**File**: [integration-phase-handoff.feature](integration-phase-handoff.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: Seamless Framework Phase Integration
  As a project manager
  I want seamless integration between framework phases
  So that project progression is smooth and validated

  Scenario: Development to Deployment handoff
    Given Development Framework Phase 6 is completed successfully
    When Deployment Framework Phase 7 begins
    Then all development artifacts are validated and accessible
    And infrastructure requirements are clearly documented
    And security controls are implemented and tested
    And performance targets are achieved and verified
    And deployment strategy is approved and ready for execution
```

#### **AI Agent Coordination BDD**
**File**: [integration-ai-agent-coordination.feature](integration-ai-agent-coordination.feature)
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Agent Coordination and Collaboration
  As a framework user
  I want AI agents to coordinate effectively across complex tasks
  So that multi-agent workflows execute seamlessly

  Scenario: Security auditor and cloud DevOps expert collaboration
    Given security controls need to be deployed with infrastructure
    When deployment framework provisions cloud infrastructure
    Then security-auditor agent validates security requirements
    And cloud-devops-expert agent implements infrastructure with security controls
    And both agents coordinate to ensure security compliance
    And human approval is obtained for production deployment
```

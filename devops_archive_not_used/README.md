# DevOps Framework v3.7 - DEPRECATED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MIGRATION NOTICE: DevOps Framework Has Been Separated**

**This directory contains DEPRECATED files.** The DevOps framework has been logically separated into two specialized frameworks for better organization and clarity:

### **üöÄ NEW FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE:**
- **üî® Development Framework**: Located in `../development/` - AI-first development methodology
- **üöÄ Deployment Framework**: Located in `../deployment/` - Zero-downtime deployment strategies  
- **‚öôÔ∏è Operations Framework**: Located in `../operations/` - AI-autonomous operations and monitoring

### **üìã MIGRATION PATH:**
1. **For Development Work**: Use `../development/development_framework_v3.7.md`
2. **For Deployment Work**: Use `../deployment/deployment_framework_v3.7.md`  
3. **For Operations Work**: Use `../operations/operations_framework_v3.7.md`

### **üéØ COMPLETE WORKFLOW:**
**Development ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Operations** provides clear separation of concerns and specialized AI guidance for each phase.

---

## üìã Quick Start

### **Hybrid Architecture: 90% AI + 10% Static**
- **90% Dynamic AI Execution**: Real-time intelligent automation through AI assistant commands
- **10% Static Compliance**: Essential governance templates for regulatory and audit requirements
- **Zero Traditional Scripts**: No predefined Python files, shell scripts, or complex configurations

### **Core AI Command Pattern**
```bash
"ai-devops-agent + [specialist] + [context]: [objective] with [criteria] and [constraints]"
```

### **Immediate Implementation**
```bash
# 1. Setup minimal static compliance foundation
"general-purpose: Create the 8-10 required static compliance template files in deployment/compliance-templates/"

# 2. Execute comprehensive AI testing
"test-engineer + security-auditor: Analyze current CARA codebase, generate comprehensive test suite with security validation, execute tests, and adapt strategies based on results"

# 3. Deploy with AI intelligence
"cloud-devops-expert + gcp-ai-architect: Assess deployment risk, select optimal strategy, execute with monitoring, and implement automatic rollback protection"
```
